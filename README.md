This is a Three.js project ,it has a white plane as background and has grids on it ,you get a Complete ,Copy ,Reset button.
How it works:
1. Open the HTML file ,you will be directed to webpage.
2. Right click on the screen to create vertices (when two vertices are created it forms a line.
3. Once you have created desired number of vertices ,click on Complete button(it froms line between last vertice and
    the first one thereby completing the polygon and filling the inside of the polygon with random color).
4. Now upon pressing the Copy button ,you get to copy the polygon(which will have different color each time you copy)
    and the copied polygon follows the mouse until right clicked.
5. Upon pressing the reeset button the whole scene is reset to its original condition.
